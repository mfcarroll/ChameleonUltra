"""Is the lead-time hump fixed in MILLISECONDS or in the arm's own FRAME COUNT?

⭐ **OFFLINE RE-ANALYSIS. It opens no serial port, arms nothing and moves no cell.** Every number
comes out of `caps/k12_gproxii_s17.json`, `k13_gproxii_s41.json`, `k14_gproxii_s73.json`,
`k15_indala_keri_s91.json` and `k16_indala_keri_s137.json`, which `burstsync.py` wrote before
anything formatted them.

## ⭐⭐ THE QUESTION, AND IT WAS PRE-REGISTERED BY THE ROUND THAT RAISED IT

`rfid-tools` `QUEUE.md`, committed `599b0b9` at 2026-09-17 02:05, lists the next hands-off units
and this is its second: *"Is the hole/hump fixed in lead time or in the arm's own frame count? —
the same arithmetic that turned C494's 6x spread into frames (C499). Cheap, and it would explain
the sign difference if it works."* ⭐ **The hypothesis is therefore pre-registered in the strict
sense — it was written down, in a commit, before this file existed.** What is written below is its
OPERATIONALISATION, and that is pinned here before the analysis runs.

⚠⚠ **THE DISCLOSURE THAT MATTERS, AND IT IS NOT SMALL.** These captures are BANKED, so this is a
retrodiction, not a blind test, and I had already read the prose describing K12 as *"saturated with
every reachable cell"* (C513) before writing this band. ⛔ **So a SUPPORTED verdict here would be
worth very little** — I cannot certify that a band I wrote was uninfluenced by a headline I had
read. A REFUTED verdict is the one this file can honestly carry, because foreknowledge of the
saturation cannot manufacture a collapse that is not in the data. Said here, before the run,
rather than in the write-up.

## THE ARITHMETIC (`shortread.py:112`, and none of it is new)

Each arm's frame, in 125 kHz samples and in milliseconds at 8 us/sample:

    indala  2048 = 16.384 ms      nexwatch   4096 = 32.768 ms
    keri    2048 = 16.384 ms      gproxii    6144 = 49.152 ms
    idteck  2048 = 16.384 ms      indala224  7168 = 57.344 ms

⛔ **`indala` AND `keri` CANNOT DISCRIMINATE — THEY SHARE A FRAME.** Both are 2048 samples, so
their near-identical humps at the same 65 ms (K15, K16) are exactly what BOTH hypotheses predict.
The whole question turns on `gproxii`, whose frame is 3x theirs, and the banked K12/K13 ladders are
the only thing on the bench that spans enough of its frame axis to answer it.

    lead time in frames = lead_ms / frame_ms

`indala` and `keri` peak at 65 ms = **3.97 frames**, with wings at 40 ms = 2.44 f and 80 ms =
4.88 f. `gproxii`'s notch is at 60 ms = **1.22 frames**, and its K12/K13 ladder (20..200 ms in 20 ms
steps) spans **0.41 .. 4.07 frames** — so it covers the predicted peak (3.97 f = 195 ms, the 200 ms
cell) and the whole of the predicted low wing.

## ⛔⛔ THE CRITERION, PINNED BEFORE THE ANALYSIS RUNS (M55)

**H_frame** — the hump is a feature of the arm's own frame count: high at ~3-4.3 frames, wings
collapsing at <= 2.44 f and >= 4.88 f, on every arm.
**H_ms** — the features sit at fixed millisecond lead times and the frame length is irrelevant.

⭐ **F1 — THE LOW WING IS THE HALF THAT CARRIES, AND THE HIGH HALF IS DECLARED USELESS HERE.**
`gproxii` sits near 100% across its ladder, so *"high at 3.97 f"* would pass on a saturated ladder
without evidence — the K8 NO POWER trap, named for the fourth time in this project. ⛔ **The high
half is reported and NOT counted.** The low wing is where the ladder has power: `gproxii`'s 60 ms
notch proves this ladder can show a total collapse when one is there.

  Pooled over `gproxii`'s cells at **<= 2.44 frames** — 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120 ms — in K12 and
  K13 **separately**, so the verdict has to survive two seeds:

  - pooled rate **<= 30%** in BOTH runs ⇒ **H_frame SUPPORTED**: the wing is there, moved to where
    the frame count puts it.
  - pooled rate **>= 60%** in BOTH runs ⇒ **H_frame REFUTED**: at the frame count where `indala`
    and `keri` collapse to 0-17%, `gproxii` is fine, so the feature does not travel in frames.
  - the two runs disagree, or either lands between ⇒ **no verdict**, reported as such.

  ⚠ **M59 IS RESPECTED AND THIS IS HOW.** No arm's rate is compared with another arm's. Each is
  measured against a threshold stated here before the numbers were read, which is K16's T3
  construction. The 30/60 points come from `indala`'s and `keri`'s OWN wing values (0-17%) and
  their own peaks (92-96%) as reported in C517 — i.e. from the shape H_frame says travels, not
  from `gproxii`'s ladder.

  ⛔ **THE NOTCH CELL IS INCLUDED, DELIBERATELY.** 60 ms is `gproxii`'s known 0% hole (C515,
  reproduced three times), and dropping it would RAISE the pool and make refutation easier. It
  stays in for the verdict; the pool without it is printed as a sensitivity check only.

  ⛔ **NO SINGLE CELL CAN DECIDE THIS** (M62, M64). The pool is six cells wide, it must agree
  across two independently seeded runs, and the sensitivity check says what the one anomalous cell
  is worth.

⭐ **F2 — THE SHAPE CHECK, and it is subordinate to F1.** Under H_frame `gproxii`'s ladder should
have RANGE: the six low cells pooled must sit at least **30 points** below the top three (160, 180,
200 ms). A ladder whose range is under 15 points has no shape for either hypothesis to own, and F2
reports **FLAT** — which is not a verdict for H_ms either.

⛔⛔ **WHAT THIS CANNOT DO, WRITTEN DOWN BEFORE IT RUNS.**
1. It cannot test H_frame's *hole* reading. `gproxii`'s notch is at 1.22 frames, which on `indala`
   and `keri` is **20 ms** — below K14/K15/K16's 40 ms floor. **Unmeasured, and this file does not
   guess at it.** A 20 ms cell on those two arms is a real, cheap, hands-off capture and is the
   follow-up regardless of which way F1 lands.
2. ⛔ **H_frame does not explain the sign difference even if it is SUPPORTED.** A hump at 3.97 f
   and a hole at 1.22 f are two different features at two different frame counts; frame-scaling
   relocates the disagreement, it does not dissolve it. `QUEUE.md`'s *"it would explain the sign
   difference if it works"* is too generous to the hypothesis and this file does not inherit it.
3. Ungraded throughout — no null sweep, no calibration row, no licence. **It moves no cell**, and a
   re-analysis is not a bench result (AUTOPILOT §4).
