# Next — ranked

**State:** shipped, validated both ways, and word-agnostic in simulation. `lf indala read`
returns the credential in ~0.5 s, 20/20 with the tag and 0/20 without; 36 synthetic words
decode with no wrong answers (`FINDINGS.md`). What remains is **physical** generality —
other tags, other signals, a second unit — then the levers that were closed against a
decoder that could not work.

⛔ Method rules live in `METHOD.md`, not here. Read them before adding a claim to the ledger.

## 1. ⭐ Finish the loud-signal null — HID is done, the ASK tags are not

C24 closed HID Prox: 10/10 `LF tag not found` with the tag on the antenna and its coupling
confirmed by a 5/5 HID read immediately before. That matters because it is the null the
empty field cannot provide — a decoder brute-forcing 32 offsets for a fixed pattern against
a *loud* wrong signal is a different proposition from one straining against silence.

⚠ HID Prox is FSK. EM410x, Viking, PAC and Jablotron are ASK/OOK and modulate the envelope
in a completely different way, which is what the fs/2 notch and the bit integrator actually
see. None of them are tested.

⛔ **Confirm the probe tag's coupling immediately before and after, in the same run.** Not
doing this is what made L51's measurement uninterpretable: `lf hid prox read` on this bench
is intermittent enough to sit at 0/15 for a quarter of an hour, so "the Indala read found
nothing" means nothing on its own — it has to be bracketed by proof the tag was there.

```bash
cd software/script && .venv/bin/python cu.py \
  "lf hid prox read" "lf hid prox read" \
  "lf indala read" "lf indala read" "lf indala read" \
  "lf hid prox read" "lf hid prox read"
```

## 2. ⭐⭐ A second physical Indala tag

C23 closed the *structural* half of this synthetically: 36 words decode, including the
even-parity case that C14's frame inversion never covers. What is untested is physical —
a different tag's coupling, tuning and drive level, and whether the phase window moves
with the tag rather than with the reader.

⚠ Also untested: `descramble26()` assumes format 26. A 29-bit or other-format tag should
still return a raw frame, with the Wiegand-26 parity reported as failing. Check it does
nothing worse.

⭐ **A spare T5577 turns this from "whatever tags exist" into a designed experiment**, since
the Proxmark writes an arbitrary raw frame:

```bash
cd /Users/Shared/code/personal/rfid/proxmark3 && ./pm3 -c "lf indala clone -r a0000000e6bd0e93"
```

That one is the bench word with its last bit flipped — **even parity**, so the subcarrier
stops inverting between frames. It is the single most informative word to write, because
it is the one structural branch that has only ever been tested in simulation.

## 3. ⭐ A second Chameleon

⚠ Worth doing and worth not over-reading. Two units bought together are the same hardware
revision from the same batch, so this tests unit-to-unit tolerance — antenna tuning,
component spread, trimmer position — and NOT whether the design generalises to a Chameleon
Ultra in general. A pass is weak evidence; a failure would be very strong.

## 4. ⭐⭐ Make the failure cheaper, or the success more certain

A read costs a median of 2–3 captures at ~35 ms (0.08–0.22 s of device time, measured); a
failure costs the whole 500 ms timeout (0.47–0.53 s, measured).
Two things are worth measuring now that decode rate is a real metric:

- **Sort the rotation by live evidence, not by the committed sweep.** The order is
  `20, 12, 28, 36, ...`, taken from a sweep whose phase ranking has since moved.
- **Longer settle.** A T5577 charges off the field before transmitting at full amplitude,
  and 2 ms has never been varied against a working decoder (L34 invalidated the old test).
  The Indala read restarts the field for every capture, so this is paid 2–3 times per read.

## 5. ⭐ Re-test the levers closed against the broken decoder

Air gap, settle and oversampling were all closed pre-BLE-fix on a tag carrying
`DEADBEEF/12345678` (L34), and every dB measured since went through a decoder that could
not decode. Tag position looks worth ~5.7 dB but rests on n=1 from an accidental probe.

## 6. ⚠ The per-lever sweep scripts score the wrong thing

`sweep.py`, `phasesweep.py`, `gaintest.py`, `gapsweep.py` and `oversample_test.py` all
score the fc/2 **skirt**, which is transition energy and is polarity-blind (`METHOD.md` M8).
They can rank coupling, but they cannot tell you whether something decodes. Port them to
decode rate the way `phasebits.py` was, or retire them.

## 7. Upstreamable?

Nothing in `lf_indala_psk.c` is bench-specific and it has no nRF dependency. The pieces a
PR would need beyond what is here: emulation (`lf_tag_em.c` has a transmit-only `psk1.c`
already), `lf indala write` to T5577, and the tag-type registration that
`tag_base_type.h:61` leaves as a commented-out placeholder under `//////// PSK Tag-Talk-First 300`.

## Closed — do not re-open without new evidence

| | why |
|---|---|
| `LF_RSSI` / AIN0 as a signal tap | C08/C09: no fc/2, flat to 0.5 dB, though demonstrably alive |
| SAADC gain | C10: the floor is analog-referred and tracks gain |
| Folding at 2048 samples | C14: odd parity inverts the subcarrier every frame; it cancels the data |
| Indala parity as an acceptance gate | C19: it passed a frame that was wrong in 20 bits |
| A 12 kHz cutoff for the baseband filter | C16: the cutoff was never the point; the null at fs/2 was |
